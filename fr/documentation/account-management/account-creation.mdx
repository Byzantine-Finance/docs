### 1. Account Creation

Create an account on the platform using your email or Google account. Verify your email through the confirmation email we send you.

During account creation, you will be invited to accept the Byzantine Terms and Conditions and the Bridge Terms of Service, our on-ramp and off-ramp partner. This mandatory step required by Bridge enables you:
- to deposit USD or EUR directly without manually converting them to stablecoins.
- to receive funds in fiat directly in your bank account.

### 2. Wallet Setup

Once your email is verified, you will be redirected to a page where you can select your account type.

**Account type**

- You can **use your own wallet**, link it through an available wallet platform and sign the message.
- Or **create a new, self-custodial wallet** that is fully encrypted and accessible only via passkey linked to your device.

### 3. Identity Verification

To verify your identity, run through our [KYC/KYB process](/documentation/account-management/markdown) and submit the required documents based on your profile as an individual or a legal entity.

You will need to scan your ID document and complete a biometric verification step. We work with Sumsub, an identity verification platform that supports KYC and KYB.

#### Individual verification

As an individual, you will have to provide the following documents to complete the KYC process:

- Passport or National ID cards
- Address proof may be requested depending on your situation

#### Legal entity verification

As a legal entity, you will have to provide the following documents related to your organisation:

- A **proof of registration**: This legal document serves as evidence that your business is formally recognized under the laws of your jurisdiction and is authorized to operate.
- **The articles of association**: This document establishes the internal regulations of the business.
- **A power of attorney signed by the company’s legal representative**, required if the person completing the KYB process is not an official representative of the entity or does not own more than 25% of the company’s shares or voting rights.

### 4. Approval

Complete the verification process, and your submission will be reviewed. Upon approval, you will gain access to the Byzantine App.
