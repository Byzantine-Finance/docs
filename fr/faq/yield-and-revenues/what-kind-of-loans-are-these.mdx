title: "What kind of loans are these?"
---

Indefinite, short-term rolling loans. They can be repaid or renewed at any time.

Returns accrual and collateral ratio monitoring happens at each *block* (every six seconds). If collateral value falls too far, the system automatically sells it to cover the loan.

This makes the lending market highly solvent and callable on demand.
