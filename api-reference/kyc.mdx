In order to use the Byzantine Prime application, an individual user needs to go through a KYC process. This is a regulatory obligation for individuals.

The creation of the user account is done by calling this API endpoint:

<Card title="Create a user account" icon="plus" horizontal href="/api-reference/user-accounts/create-a-byzantine-user">
  
</Card>

The following information needs to be provided:
- personal data about the user
- ID documents (passport or national ID card)
- proof of address
- optional - it is possible to add a list of `authenticators` to register user's passkey to their device

The individual user will receive an `account_id` and a `user_id`.
