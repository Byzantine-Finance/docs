title: "Legal entities - KYB"

Creating an account for an entity means submitting company information and company documents for KYB, as well as beneficiaries and details about them for KYC. This is a regulatory obligation.

To facilitate this process for integrators, on the Byzantine API, this happens through a single API call.

</Card>

The following information needs to be provided:
- company details
- personal data about every beneficiary/representative of the company
- company documents
- optional - it is possible to add a list of `authenticators` to register beneficiary's passkey to their device

The entity will receive an `account_id` and an `entity_id`. Every beneficiary/representative of the entity will have a `user_id`.

<Info>
  When creating an entity, the user creating it **must** add themselves as one of the beneficiaries/representatives.
  
  Please refer to the related endpoint page for more details about the requirements.
