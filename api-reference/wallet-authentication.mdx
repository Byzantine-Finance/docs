When a user account is created in Byzantine, either they themselves or their entity are set up with a digital wallet. This wallet is linked to either the end user's device or email address, meaning no intermediaries (Byzantine or the integrator) could ever make transactions on their behalf.

## Authentication methods

Integrators have two options when creating a client account.

### Method 1: OTP via email

This method is easier to implement, but is a little less secure, since it relies on access to the end user's email account.

### Method 2: Passkey authentication

This method is more cryptographically secure, since it directly links the end user's device to authentication, but is a bit more technically challenging to implement.
