A user deposit happens in three stages:

1. A user must approve a Byzantine vault as a valid interaction target.
2. A user must transform assets from fiat currency to stablecoins, known as _on-ramping_.
3. A user must deposit these stablecoins into an Byzantine vault.

## Approving a vault

Approving a vault is an additional security measure to ensure that the client's wallet cannot interact with fraudulent smart contracts.

This approval is a one-time requirement per vault, typically performed when a user interacts with a specific vault for the first time. Once approved, the user does not need to repeat this step for subsequent deposits into the same vault.

The integrator must call two functions:

1. [Get approval transaction](/api-reference/approve-vault-for-deposit/get-approval-transaction), which requests the transaction body to sign.
2. [Submit approval transaction](/api-reference/approve-vault-for-deposit/submit-approval-transaction), which submits the signed transaction.

## On-ramping assets

On-ramping assets is done via [Bridge](https://www.bridge.xyz/), our on- and off-ramping partner.

## Depositing into a Byzantine vault

Making the deposit is once again a two-step transaction.

1. [Get deposit transaction](/api-reference/make-deposit/get-deposit-transaction), which requests the transaction body to sign.
2. [Submit deposit transaction](/api-reference/make-deposit/submit-deposit-transaction), which submits the signed transaction.

    </Tab>

## Withdrawing from a Byzantine vault

Withdrawing funds from a Byzantine vault is a streamlined process that does not require vault approval. Withdrawals are available at any time, allowing users to access their funds whenever needed.

The withdrawal process follows the same two-step transaction pattern as deposits:

1. [Get withdrawal transaction](/api-reference/make-withdrawal/get-withdrawal-transaction), which requests the transaction body to sign.
2. [Submit withdrawal transaction](/api-reference/make-withdrawal/submit-withdrawal-transaction), which submits the signed transaction.
