Byzantine is a modular infrastructure layer for institutional digital credit - built for integrators, fintechs, and developers who want to embed better institutional-grade yield directly into their platforms.

The Byzantine API is unified, composable, and simple to use. With one endpoint structure, integrators can retrieve vault data, create and manage accounts, and handle deposits and withdrawals programmatically - all through a single integration.
