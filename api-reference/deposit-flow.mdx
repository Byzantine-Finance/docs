A user deposit happens in three stages:

1. A user must approve a Byzantine vault as a valid interaction target.
2. A user must transform assets from fiat currency to stablecoins, known as _on-ramping_.
3. A user must deposit these stablecoins into an Byzantine vault.

## Approving a vault

Approving a vault is an additional security measure to ensure that the client's wallet cannot interact with fraudulent smart contracts.

The integrator must call two functions:

1. [Get approval transaction](/api-reference/approve-vault-for-deposit/get-approval-transaction)
2. [Make approval transaction](/api-reference/approve-vault-for-deposit/submit-approval-transaction)

## On-ramping assets

On-ramping assets is done via [Bridge](https://www.bridge.xyz/), our on- and off-ramping partner.
