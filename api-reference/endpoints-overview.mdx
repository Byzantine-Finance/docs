## Query vault data

- Discover active vaults and their performance using `Top vaults`, `Vault APY`, and `History` endpoints.

## Query user data

- Retrieve vault activity for a single user: deposits, withdrawals, and aggregate positions.

## Account data

- Check transaction statuses and historical activity after deposits/withdrawals are initiated.
- Use these endpoints to confirm when funds finish on-ramping or when a withdrawal settles.

## Account management & user accounts

- Create and manage entities and users, including KYC/KYB payloads and supporting documents.
- Complete the account creation process to enable on-ramping and off-ramping.

## Transactions with passkey

- `Get approve/deposit/withdraw body` endpoints return unsigned transactions for passkey-based flows.
- `Send transaction` broadcasts a signed payload after collecting the user’s WebAuthn signature.

## Transactions with OTP

- Use the OTP `init` endpoints to trigger an email OTP for approve/deposit/withdraw flows.
- `Complete transaction` finalizes the OTP-authenticated transaction after the user enters the code.

## Query API health

- `GET /api/v1/health` returns the service status.

## Terms of Service

- Obtain the Bridge ToS acceptance link before creating user accounts.
