1. [ABOUT BYZANTINE](/documentation/about-byzantine)

## Deposits in USD

Every client is able to invest directly in fiat USD thanks to a digital asset *on-ramping partner.* Reconciliation is handled automatically. You will be notified when your transfer is completed.

## Deposits in USDC

Advanced clients are able to deposit in [stablecoins](/documentation/digital-assets-101/whats-a-stablecoin) directly - digital assets backed 1:1 by real assets (cash or short-term government bonds).

To make such a deposit, clients need to have chosen the "Self-managed account" during the onboarding process. For clients looking to switch to this account type after onboarding, please get in touch with us: [info@byzantine.fi](mailto:info@byzantine.fi).
