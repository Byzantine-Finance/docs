title: "What is Byzantine Prime?"
---

Welcome to the paradox of company cash management.

For every company, cash is both a lifeline and a liability. It pays salaries, secures suppliers, and anchors confidence - yet it quietly loses value every single day.

## The problem

Most treasurers are stuck choosing between underwhelming options:

- **Bank deposits:** Safe, but earning next to nothing. In a world of persistent inflation, parked cash is shrinking cash.
- **T-Bills and money market funds:** Marginally better, yielding 1–4% in recent years. But these products were designed for a slower era. Redemption delays, rigid structures, and underwhelming returns make them a poor fit for businesses that need both safety and agility.
- **Equities and broader markets:** Averaging ~9% a year over the long run. Great on paper, disastrous in practice. What looks like yield one month can turn into a loss the next — unacceptable for funds meant to safeguard a business.•

So, company cash ends up exactly where it’s always been: Safe, stagnant, and silently eroded by inflation.

## Byzantine Prime

Byzantine Prime is a digital credit product designed to help companies and investors earn safe, predictable returns on their cash or digital assets. Assets are deployed only into blue-chip, overcollateralised credit opportunities.

Byzantine Prime permits instant deposits and withdrawals, making it both a safe choice for treasuries & funds and a preferred choice for short-term capital allocations.

Parking cash in Byzantine Prime rather than a traditional bank account allows you to earn above-market returns with the safety of Money Market Funds or traditional credit funds, thanks to the efficiency of blockchain protocols. Additionally, unlike those products, Byzantine Prime offers instant access to your funds with no notice or withdrawal fees.

Think of it as similar to a high-quality savings account or money market fund, but built on transparent blockchain technology, with double the returns.
