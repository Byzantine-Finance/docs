## Annual fees on performance

Byzantine charges a fixed **10% of returns**, calculated daily and deducted directly from returns. Account balances are always displayed net of all fees.

## Deposit & withdrawal fees (fiat)

For fiat deposits and withdrawals, a **0.2% fiat conversion fee** is applied for both on-ramp and off-ramp transactions as a result of Bridge conversion costs.
