## Structure and legal nature

Byzantine Finance SAS acts solely as a technical service provider, offering the software and interfaces enabling clients to access regulated counterparties and on-chain investment strategies. Byzantine does not hold, control, or intermediate client assets, nor does it execute transactions on behalf of users.

Byzantine Prime operates through a decentralised smart contract vault architecture. The product is a non-custodial, technology-based investment infrastructure, not a collective investment scheme or managed fund.

## Partner oversight and licensing

The investment infrastructure integrates several regulated entities, each operating under its own legal and regulatory framework:

- **Keyrock Asset Management**, a registered Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP), manages the smart contract vault and executes the investment strategy.
- **On-/off-ramp partners** are licensed financial institutions that conduct operate as the fiat on-/off-ramp under their own regulatory authorisation.
- **Partner custodians** provide secure infrastructure layers to safeguard digital asset transactions and access management.

Each partner operates under independent regulatory supervision and maintains its own licences, compliance, and risk management policies.

## Client asset control and safeguards

Clients retain full and continuous control over their funds through self-custodial wallets. At no point can Byzantine or any third party access, move, or otherwise control client assets without explicit authorisation through the clientâ€™s own wallet signature.

All transactions are executed via audited smart contracts, designed for transparency, immutability, and automatic enforcement of investment strategies.

## Transparency and legal documentation
