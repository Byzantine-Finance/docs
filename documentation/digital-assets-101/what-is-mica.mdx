<Info>
  **In short:** MiCA makes digital finance as safe and regulated as traditional finance - but faster and more efficient.
</Info>

MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is the European Union’s law for digital assets - the first complete legal framework in the world for digital assets and stablecoins.

It sets clear, strict rules for how digital assets are issued, stored, and managed across all EU countries.

As a result, MiCA makes digital assets fully regulated and supervised, just like traditional financial products.

## Key protections:

- Stablecoins must be fully backed by real money or short-term bonds.
- Companies must operate under licences, audits, and risk controls.
- Regulators can monitor and act against any non-compliant player.

## The impact

MiCA removes the “grey area” around digital assets. It gives investors and companies legal certainty and strong consumer protection.
