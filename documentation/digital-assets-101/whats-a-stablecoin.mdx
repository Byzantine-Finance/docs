1. [DIGITAL ASSETS 101](/documentation/digital-assets-101)

**In short:** Stablecoins are real money, in digital form - stable, transparent, and always redeemable 1:1.

Stablecoins are digital versions of traditional currencies, like the euro or the dollar.

Each stablecoin is backed 1:1 by real assets (cash or short-term government bonds) held by regulated institutions.

1 digital euro = 1 real euro in reserve.

## Why do stablecoins exist?

They combine the stability of traditional money with the speed and efficiency of digital infrastructure - moving instantly, 24/7, anywhere in the world.

## Are stablecoins safe?

Yes. They are:

* Fully backed by real reserves.

* Audited and transparent, with public reporting.

* Increasingly managed and custodied by regulated institutions.
