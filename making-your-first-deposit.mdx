## Step 1: Choose your product

From your dashboard, click **"Deposit"** on your preferred product:

- **EUR Insured** - For euro-denominated deposits with insurance
- **USD Insured** - For dollar-denominated deposits with insurance
- **EUR/USD** - Uninsured products (slightly higher returns)

## Step 2: Generate your unique IBAN

When you click "Deposit," Byzantine creates a **unique IBAN exclusively for your account**. This account:

- Is held by you and only you
- Cannot be accessed by Byzantine or third parties
- Routes funds directly to your blockchain vault

You'll need to sign the transaction with your passkey to proceed.

## Step 3: Transfer funds

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**

1. Scan the QR code with your phone
2. Select your bank (Revolut, Société Générale, etc.)
3. Confirm the pre-filled transfer in your banking app

**Option B: Manual transfer**

1. Click "Transfer manually"
2. Copy the provided IBAN details:
   - Account holder
   - IBAN
   - BIC/SWIFT
   - Reference number (important!)
3. Make a standard bank transfer from your business account

**Transfer time:** 4-5 minutes on average

## Step 4: Automatic conversion & deployment

Once funds arrive:

1. **Currency conversion:** EUR/USD → USDC (stablecoin issued by Circle)
2. **FX hedging:** If you deposited EUR, we hedge the EUR/USDC rate to protect against currency fluctuations
3. **Deployment:** Funds are immediately deployed to your selected product
4. **Confirmation:** You'll see the updated balance in your dashboard

**You start earning returns immediately upon deployment.**
