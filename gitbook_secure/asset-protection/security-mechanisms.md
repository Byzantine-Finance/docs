# Security mechanisms

At Byzantine, safety is our top priority:

* All smart contracts used in this strategy are [audited](security-audits.md) and battle-tested extensively.
* Byzantine’s vault is built on Morpho V2’s audited architecture, inheriting its security guarantees and further strengthened by Byzantine’s custom risk tooling.
* The capital is held in a vault that has been [audited](security-audits.md) by seven independent security firms (see the full list of auditors below).
* In addition, Byzantine integrates with [Hypernative](https://www.hypernative.io/), a real-time DeFi risk monitoring platform that continuously detects threats and anomalies, helping to prevent exploits before they impact client funds.
* Additionally, two live bug bounty programs are in place - see below.

Byzantine Finance never controls your assets. They are held in an account exclusively controlled by you.

## Bug bounties

Bug bounties are monetary rewards for any hackers that identify vulnerabilities and share them with the project team. They&#x20;

## Active risk monitoring via Hypernative

Risk is actively monitored via Keyrock’s proprietary risk systems as well as a third-party monitoring tool ([Hypernative](https://www.hypernative.io/)). These systems track protocol health, liquidity depth, oracle accuracy, and smart contract risk in real time.

## Continuous Rebalancing

The curator rebalances the strategy daily to:

* Ensure liquidity is always available in underlying vaults, even during market stress.
* Optimise yield and capital efficiency while maintaining risk thresholds.

In practice, this means Byzantine delivers a hands-off, fully managed allocation: risk, liquidity, and optimization are monitored and executed continuously so clients can treat this as a set-and-forget treasury product.
