## SOC 2 Type II reports

Byzantineâ€™s products are operated under the regulatory and operational framework of our strategy manager Keyrock, who is SOC 2 Type II certified by Deloitte. This certification, issued by an independent auditor, verifies that Keyrock maintains the highest standards of security, availability, and confidentiality in managing sensitive financial operations.

In practice, this means that operational processes, internal controls, and data handling are covered by a SOC 2 Type II framework.
