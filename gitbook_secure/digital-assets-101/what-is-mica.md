# What is MiCA?

{% hint style="info" %}
**In short:** MiCA makes digital finance as safe and regulated as traditional finance - but faster and more efficient.
{% endhint %}

MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) is the European Union’s law for digital assets - the first complete legal framework in the world for digital assets and stablecoins.&#x20;

It sets clear, strict rules for how digital assets are issued, stored, and managed across all EU countries.

As a result, MiCA makes digital assets fully regulated and supervised, just like traditional financial products.&#x20;

## Key protections:

* Stablecoins must be fully backed by real money or short-term bonds.
* Companies must operate under licences, audits, and risk controls.
* Regulators can monitor and act against any non-compliant player.&#x20;

## The impact

MiCA removes the “grey area” around digital assets. It gives investors and companies legal certainty and strong consumer protection.
