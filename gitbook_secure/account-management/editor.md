# Account creation

## How To Create An Account With [KYC/KYB](markdown.md)?&#x20;

### 1. Account Creation

Create an account on our app at [Byzantine](https://app.byzantine.fi/) using your email or Google account. Verify your email through the confirmation email we send you.&#x20;

### 2. Wallet Setup

Verify your email to be redirected to a page where you can select your account type.

**Account type**

* You can use your own wallet, link it through an available wallet platform and sign the message.
* Or create a new, self-custodial wallet that is fully encrypted and accessible only via passkey linked to your device.

### 3. Identity Verification

To verify your identity, run through our [KYC/KYB process](markdown.md) and submit the required documents based on your profile as an individual or a legal entity.

You will need to scan your ID document and complete a biometric verification step. We work with Sumsub, an identity verification platform that supports KYC and KYB.

#### Individual verification

As an individual, you will have to provide the following documents to complete the KYC process:

* Passport or National ID cards
* Address proof may be requested depending on your situation

#### Legal entity verification

As a legal entity, you will have to provide the following documents related to your organisation:&#x20;

* A **proof of registration**: This legal document serves as evidence that your business is formally recognized under the laws of your jurisdiction and is authorized to operate.
* **The articles of association**: This document establishes the internal regulations of the business.
* **A power of attorney signed by the company’s legal representative**, required if the person completing the KYB process is not an official representative of the entity or does not own more than 25% of the company’s shares or voting rights.

### 4. Approval

Complete the verification process, and your submission will be reviewed. Upon approval, you will gain access to the Byzantine App.
