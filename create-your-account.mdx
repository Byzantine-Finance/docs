### **Company vs Individual**

**Choose "Company" if:**

- Funds belong to a legal entity (SAS, SARL, holding company, family office structure).
- You're investing on behalf of a corporate entity.
- The bank account sending funds is in a company name.

**Choose "Individual" if:**

- You're investing personal funds.
- The bank account is in your personal name.

<Info>
  **For family offices:** Most family offices should select **Company**, even if the structure is a holding company with no commercial activity.
</Info>

## Step 4: Setting up security

### Account security options

We **recommend "Create a new account"** (default option) for maximum security:

- **Create a new account:** Everything's handled for you, just sign up and start earning.
- **Use an existing account:** For advanced users only.

### Passkey authentication

After selecting "Create a secure account," you'll set up a **passkey**:

1. Your browser will prompt you to create a passkey.
2. This creates a unique digital fingerprint on your device.
3. You'll use this to authenticate important actions (deposits, withdrawals, etc.).

<Info>
  **Passkeys are more secure than passwords** and work with Face ID, Touch ID, or device PIN.
