## How does the deposit process work?

1. Our payment processing partner Bridge creates a _unique IBAN_ for your account
2. You transfer EUR/USD from your bank account
3. Bridge converts these funds to EURC/USDC (stablecoin)
4. Assets deploy automatically into your selected product
5. You start earning immediately

## What happens to my EUR deposits? Is it converted USD?

No, your EUR are converted to EURC (a stablecoin pegged to EUR). When you withdraw, you receive EUR at the original exchange rate.

## How long do deposits take?

4-5 minutes on average for the bank transfer to arrive, then immediate deployment.

## Can I restrict who can make withdrawals?

Yes. Only **Admin** users can execute withdrawals. **View-only** users can see the account but cannot move funds.

## Can someone on my team change the withdrawal bank account to steal funds?

No. Only admin users can change bank account details or initiate withdrawals.
