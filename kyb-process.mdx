## Do I need a KYC or KYB?

- **KYB (Know Your Business)** - If funds come from a company bank account and the account is held in a company's name
- **KYC (Know Your Customer)** - If funds come from a personal bank account

Most family offices need **KYB** since assets are held in corporate structures.

## My holding company doesn't have a website. What should I enter?

Enter nothing - thjat field is optional. You'll need to provide additional proof of funds (e.g., bank statements or company balance sheet) during verification later.

## We have a complex ownership structure (companies owning companies). How do we handle UBOs?

You must list the **individual persons** who ultimately own the company, not the intermediate corporate entities.

Example: If Company A (owned by John 50%, Marie 50%) owns 50% of your family office, list:

- John - 25% (via Company A)
- Marie - 25% (via Company A)

## How long does KYB verification take?

Typically 24-48 hours after you submit all documents and complete identity verification.

## Can someone on my team complete the KYB on behalf of the client?

Yes, your team can fill out all the forms, but the beneficial owner(s) must complete the final identity verification (facial recognition) themselves.
