## Who holds the private keys to my funds?

You do. Byzantine creates a secure, self-custodial wallet infrastructure where only you have access. Byzantine cannot move your funds without your explicit authorization (passkey signature).

## Is Byzantine regulated?

Byzantine partners with regulated entities:

- **Bridge** (Virtual Asset Service Provider - VASP registered)
- **Keyrock Group** (risk management)

Byzantine itself provides technology infrastructure, not regulated financial services.

## What happens if Byzantine shuts down?

Your funds are held in your own blockchain wallet, not Byzantine's. You maintain access to your assets independently of Byzantine's operations.
