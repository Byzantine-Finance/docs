title: "Who can move assets?"
---

Funds can only move in three ways:

1. Investor deposit or withdrawal

2. Automated yield distribution

3. Strategy rebalancing within pre-approved markets (more on the mandate of Keyrock, the strategy manager, later)

All three function via pre-defined, immutable smart-contract functions.
