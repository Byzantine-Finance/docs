# How are assets segregated by client?

Client assets are never co-mingled with assets of non-KYC’d depositors in the Byzantine vault.

Moreover, the receipt tokens clients - which represent ownership over deposited assets - are fully segregated in the client wallet. This can either be a client’s self-custodial wallet or a wallet the client created as part of the on-boarding process.

At no point are funds held on a corporate balance sheet or exposed to operational discretion, not even in the case of Keyrock (the strategy manager).

Investor assets are segregated within on-chain vaults governed by Byzantine Prime’s contracts.

No funds are held on a corporate balance sheet or exposed to operational discretion.
