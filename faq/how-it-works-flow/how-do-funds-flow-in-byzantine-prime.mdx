In essence, Byzantine Prime is a digital overcollateralised credit product. It functions like a digital credit facility whose processes are automated through transparent smart contracts that replicate the mechanics of a money-market instrument.

This blockchain automation has three key advantages:

* Automated back-office and transaction processing via smart contracts

* Removal of counterparty risk via smart contracts

* Massive reduction of credit risk via 100% overcollateralisation

All operations (deposits, interest accrual, collateral management, and redemptions) are executed automatically, 24/7, with full on-chain visibility.
