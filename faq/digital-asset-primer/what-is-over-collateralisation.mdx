title: "What is over-collateralisation?"
---


To borrow \$1 worth of stablecoins, a user must typically lock up \$1.20 - \$1.50 in digital assets as collateral.

The smart contracts monitor asset prices in real-time and if the value of that collateral drops, the system automatically sells part of it to repay lenders before any loss occurs.

This excess-collateral rule is what keeps the system solvent and allows Byzantine Prime to provide credit yield without unsecured counterparty risk.
