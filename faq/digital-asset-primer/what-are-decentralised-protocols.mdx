Aave, Morpho, and Maker are open systems known as *protocols,* where people can lend or borrow digital assets directly through smart contracts. After putting up a certain amount of collateral, users are able to borrow from capital pools. The advantage of this system is that transactions are instant and liquidation processes are automatic.

Aave, Morpho, and Maker operate continuously, setting interest rates through supply and demand and automatically selling collateral if a borrowerâ€™s position becomes risky.

Byzantine Prime connects to these marketplaces and allocates capital across them as instructed by Keyrock, selecting only those that meet specific safety, liquidity, and audit standards.
