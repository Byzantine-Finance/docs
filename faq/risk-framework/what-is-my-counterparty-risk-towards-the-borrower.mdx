Investors have no direct credit exposure to any individual borrower.

All loans originate through decentralised markets where each borrowing position is fully over-collateralised and monitored in real time.

The borrowerâ€™s obligation is enforced entirely by smart contracts - not by trust or a legal claim - and automatically liquidated in case the margin is breached. If the borrower fails to maintain the required collateral ratio, set at a minimum of 120%, the system automatically liquidates the collateral to repay the loan before any loss can occur.
