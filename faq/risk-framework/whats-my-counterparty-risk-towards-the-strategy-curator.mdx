Investors have no direct credit exposure to the asset manager.

All operations - deposits, lending, redemptions, and yield distribution - are executed programmatically by smart contracts. As a result, even in case of a bankruptcy on the side of Keyrock, the strategy they set continues operating without a hitch.

The asset manager (Keyrock, in the institutional setup) has mandated control parameters but no custody of client assets and cannot unilaterally move funds. This enforces total bankruptcy-remoteness.
