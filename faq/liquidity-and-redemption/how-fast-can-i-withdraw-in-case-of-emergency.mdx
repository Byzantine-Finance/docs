title: "How fast can I withdraw in case of emergency?"

Byzantine Prime is designed for daily liquidity with near-instant settlement on-chain.

Investors can request withdrawals at any time, as there are no lock-ups or redemption windows.

Under normal conditions, withdrawals in stablecoins settle in under one minute, depending on blockchain network congestion.

This is comparable to intraday liquidity in a money-market fund, but with automated 24/7 availability rather than business-hour constraints.
