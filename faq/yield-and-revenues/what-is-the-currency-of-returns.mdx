Deposits and returns are both denominated in stablecoins, in this case USDC.

When a user withdraws, both their original deposit and accrued interest are available in the same currency, ready to convert into fiat if needed via an integrated off-ramping mechanism.

Clients can withdraw from Byzantine Prime instantly, receiving their USDC stablecoins.
