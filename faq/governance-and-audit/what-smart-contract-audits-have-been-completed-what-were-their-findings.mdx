The Byzantine vault has undergone seven independent audits by industry-leading firms. Each audit verified contract logic, tested liquidation and yield-distribution mechanisms, and reviewed permission boundaries. These audits were:

- [Zellic](https://github.com/Byzantine-Finance/debt-fund-vault-v2/blob/main/audits/2025-07-15-zellic.pdf)
- 2x Spearbit ([report #1](https://github.com/Byzantine-Finance/credit-vault-v2/blob/main/audits/2025-05-19-spearbit.pdf), [report #2](https://github.com/Byzantine-Finance/credit-vault-v2/blob/main/audits/2025-08-11-spearbit.pdf))

**All critical and high-severity issues identified during testing were remediated prior to deployment**, and final reports confirmed that the code conforms to the intended security and functional standards.
