Yes. Beyond periodic audits, Byzantine Prime maintains real-time automated monitoring of all deployed contracts and protocol interactions. For this, we use [Hypernative](https://www.hypernative.io/), the market-leading third-party monitoring tool.

Hypernativeâ€™s capacities include recognising and preventing on-chain attacks, and triggering response measures.

Triggers include:

* High liquidity utilisation of an underlying market.

* Unusually high amount of liquidations in an underlying protocol.

* Unusual asset movements, especially in large quantities, within and underlying market or marketplace.

* Suspected attack patterns in newly deployed on-chain code.

In most cases, Hypernative notifies Byzantine Finance and Keyrock of any irregularities. However, in rare, urgent emergencies, Hyperactive has the power to trigger a special function that withdraws funds from an underlying credit marketplace into the safety of the Byzantine main vault.

This continuous assurance framework, in which all critical system components are enrolled, ensures that operational and code-level risks remain visible and controlled at all times. Any protocol upgrade or dependency change automatically triggers a new independent audit before redeployment.
