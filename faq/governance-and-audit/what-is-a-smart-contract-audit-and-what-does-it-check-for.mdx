title: "What is a smart-contract audit and what does it check for?"
---

A smart-contract audit is the digital equivalent of a systems or code review performed by an independent security firm. The auditor analyses the underlying code line by line to ensure it behaves as intended and cannot be exploited.

Typical checks include:

* **Access control:** Verifying that only authorised actions (deposits, withdrawals, parameter updates) can occur.

* **Logic and arithmetic correctness:** Ensuring calculations for interest, collateral ratios, and liquidations cannot overflow or misfire.

* **Re-entrancy and exploit protection:** Confirming the code cannot be manipulated through repeated or nested transactions.

* **Upgrade and dependency safety:** Reviewing external calls, oracles, and integrations for hidden vulnerabilities.

Once the audit is complete, a public report summarises all findings, remediation actions, and a final risk score.
