## Step 8: Ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs)

![Screenshot 2026 02 06 At 18 42 21](/images/Screenshot2026-02-06at18.42.21.png)

**You must add:**

![Screenshot 2026 02 06 At 18 42 34](/images/Screenshot2026-02-06at18.42.34.png)

- Full name
- Email address
- Role (UBO or Representative)

<Tip>
  **What about complex ownership structures?**

  If your company is owned by other companies (e.g., 4 holding companies each with 25%), you must list the **individuals** who ultimately own those companies, not the corporate entities themselves.
</Tip>

**Example:**

- ❌ Wrong: "Holding Company A (25%)"
- ✅ Correct: "Jean Dupont (25% via Holding Company A)"

## Step 9: Invite all associated persons to complete an individual verification

![Screenshot 2026 02 06 At 18 45 53](/images/Screenshot2026-02-06at18.45.53.png)

All identified UBOs and representatives will need to complete a KYC process. You'll find more information here:  [For individuals](/for-individual-accounts).

- Click **"Verify now"** if you are that person to start your KYC process immediately.
- Click **"Send to email"** to send this person an automated email inviting them to complete their KYC.

## Step 9: Wait for verification

Once all associated persons submit their KYC, the file is automatically submitted for review - no further action is needed from your end.
