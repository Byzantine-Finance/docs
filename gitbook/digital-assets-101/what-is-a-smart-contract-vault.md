# What is a smart contract vault?

A smart contract is self-executing code on the blockchain that automates financial transactions.

It removes the need for intermediaries: Once programmed, it runs exactly as written.

Smart contract _vaults_ are special smart contracts designed for the handling and distribution of assets.

The smart contract vaults used by Byzantine have been [extensively audited by third-party security firms](../asset-protection/security-audits.md) to ensure theyâ€™re safe before managing client funds.
