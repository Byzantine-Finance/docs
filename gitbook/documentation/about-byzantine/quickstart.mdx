1. [ABOUT BYZANTINE](/documentation/about-byzantine)

Welcome to the paradox of company cash management.

For every company, cash is both a lifeline and a liability. It pays salaries, secures suppliers, and anchors confidence - yet it quietly loses value every single day.

## The problem

Most treasurers are stuck choosing between underwhelming options:

* **Bank deposits:** Safe, but earning next to nothing. In a world of persistent inflation, parked cash is shrinking cash.

* **T-Bills and money market funds:** Marginally better, yielding 1–4% in recent years. But these products were designed for a slower era. Redemption delays, rigid structures, and underwhelming returns make them a poor fit for businesses that need both safety and agility.

* **Equities and broader markets:** Averaging \~9% a year over the long run. Great on paper, disastrous in practice. What looks like yield one month can turn into a loss the next — unacceptable for funds meant to safeguard a business.•

So, company cash ends up exactly where it’s always been: Safe, stagnant, and silently eroded by inflation.

## Byzantine Prime

Byzantine Prime is a digital credit product designed to help companies and investors earn safe, predictable returns on their cash or digital assets. Assets are deployed only into blue-chip, overcollateralised credit opportunities.

Byzantine Prime permits instant deposits and withdrawals, making it both a safe choice for treasuries & funds and a preferred choice for short-term capital allocations.

Parking cash in Byzantine Prime rather than a traditional bank account allows you to earn above-market returns with the safety of Money Market Funds or traditional credit funds, thanks to the efficiency of blockchain protocols. Additionally, unlike those products, Byzantine Prime offers instant access to your funds with no notice or withdrawal fees.

Think of it as similar to a high-quality savings account or money market fund, but built on transparent blockchain technology, with double the returns.

## Why Byzantine Prime is different

* **Predictable returns**: Conservative and daily returns, independent from speculative incentives.
* **Diversified, blue-chip credit portfolio**: Returns come from carefully selected institutional lending protocols (Morpho, Aave, Compound, Maker, etc.).
* **Compliance-First**: Built with AMF/MiCA/SOC 2 Type II alignment, KYC/AML integration, and optional insurance.
* **Regulated asset manager**: Managed by Keyrock, custodied by Anchorage, insured by AON as an option.
* **Withdraw anytime**: 24/7 liquidity access, no fees.
* **Operational Fit**: Detailed tax reporting via our API.

### Our Company

Byzantine Finance was founded to help companies and investors earn safe, predictable returns on their assets. Our mission is to build trusted financial solutions for modern investors.

We created Byzantine after realizing that many organizations leave significant amounts of capital sitting idle. Our goal is to put that unused cash to work through secure, compliant strategies that generate consistent returns without compromising liquidity.

Think of it as a high-quality savings account or money market fund, but built on transparent blockchain technology, with double the returns.

FIX IMAGE

* Convert them into stablecoins (digital dollars or euros that are always 1:1 with fiat currency)

* Invest them across secure, audited lending markets

* Manage everything for you: currency hedging, risk monitoring, and liquidity. You simply deposit, watch your balance grow, and withdraw whenever needed.

### How it works?

Clients deposit stablecoins, a type of digital assets that are backed 1:1 by cash or treasury bills, which are then spread across blue-chip lending protocols: Morpho, Aave, Maker/Sky, and Compound.

**What is a stablecoin?** A stablecoin is a digital version of traditional currency (like USD or EUR) that is designed to always stay at a fixed value, typically 1:1 with its fiat counterpart. For example, USDC is always intended to be worth $1.
