# The digital asset opportunity

Behind the scenes of traditional finance, a new kind of money has taken off: over $240 billion in “digital dollars” now circulate worldwide.

Think of it as money that finally got an upgrade. Same euros, same dollars - just able to move 24/7, instantly, with no bank holidays or business hours.

These digital versions of money are called stablecoins. Learn more about them [here](../digital-assets-101/whats-a-stablecoin.md).

They’re fully backed 1:1 by real reserves, managed by regulated institutions, and verified by public audits. Stablecoins are instant, transparent, and global. Today, they’re already the foundation of digital asset markets, but for most companies and institutions, it’s still an untapped opportunity.

## So why isn’t every treasury already earning from it?

Because the asset class is ready - but the packaging isn’t. Institutional investors have been waiting for three things:

1. Security. The same level of protection and reputation they expect from traditional finance.
2. Compliance. Clear rules, full audits, zero grey zones.
3. Control. Perfect liquidity and transparent risk management.

Until recently, digital markets didn’t offer that. They were too technical, too fast, too risky.

**Now that’s changing.**

## What did change?

For the first time, the digital markets that once felt like the Wild West now look more like Wall Street - just faster, cheaper, and awake 24/7.

And the regulatory framework has caught up. The European Union’s MiCA regulation now provides a clear rulebook for digital assets, giving institutional investors the same legal certainty they expect from traditional securities. As a result, stablecoins have exploded in growth.

Bank-grade custodians like BitGo, Anchorage Digital, and others have entered the field, ensuring that digital assets are protected with the same rigor as any other institutional investment.

And insurers like AON are extending coverage to risks once deemed uninsurable - a sign not just of market maturity, but of confidence from some of the most conservative actors in finance.

## The result

A trillion-dollar market finally open to treasuries, funds, and corporates that want real yield without real headaches: **Institutional access to digital credit markets safely, transparently, and at scale.**
