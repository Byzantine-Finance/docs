## Do I need a crypto wallet?

No. Byzantine creates and manages the wallet infrastructure for you. You interact entirely through the web dashboard.

## What blockchain do you use?

We use public blockchain infrastructure (primarily Ethereum and Base) with institutional-grade security.

## Can I see my wallet address?

Yes, your wallet address is listed on any accounting report you generate.
